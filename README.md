## Build Instructions:
### Installing the Required Programs
First, you need to install the **latest** Haxe and HaxeFlixel. I'm too lazy to write and keep updated with that setup (which is pretty simple). 
1. [Install Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/)
2. [Install HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/) after downloading Haxe (make sure to do `haxelib run lime setup flixel` to install the necessary libraries, basically just follow the whole guide)

You should make sure to keep Haxe & Flixel updated. If there is a compilation error, it might be due to having an outdated version.

You'll also need to install a couple things that involve Gits. To do this, you need to do a few things first.
1. Download [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Works for Windows, Mac, and Linux, just select your build.
2. Follow instructions to install the application properly.
3. Run `haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc` to install Discord RPC.
4. Run `haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit` to install LuaJIT. If you get an error about StatePointer when using Lua, run `haxelib remove linc_luajit` into Command Prompt/PowerShell, then re-install linc_luajit. (If you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml)
5. Run `haxelib git hscript https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hscript` to install hscript. After that, run `haxelib git hscript-ex https://github.com/ianharrigan/hscript-ex` to install hscript-ex. (If you don't want your mod to be able to run .hscript scripts, delete the "HSCRIPT_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml)
6. Run `haxelib install hxCodec` to install hxCodec for video support. (If you don't want your mod to have video support, delete the "VIDEOS_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml)

You should have everything ready for compiling the game! Follow the guide below to continue!

### Compiling game
NOTE: If you see any messages relating to deprecated packages, ignore them. They're just warnings that don't affect compiling

#### HTML5
Compiling to browser is very simple. You just need to run `lime test html5 -debug` (remove "-debug" for official releases) in the root of the project to build and run the HTML5 version. (command prompt navigation guide can be found [here](https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/news/post/1090480))

Do note that modpacks and Lua scripts are unavailable in HTML5.

#### Desktop
To run it from your desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) it can be a bit more involved.

(NOTE: Mac and Linux have not been tested yet and they are not guaranteed to function)

For Windows, you need to install [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). While installing VSC, don't click on any of the options to install workloads. Instead, go to the individual components tab and choose the following:
* MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest)
* Windows 10 SDK (10.0.17763.0)

This will take a while and requires about 4GB of space. Once that is done you can open up a command line in the project's directory and run `lime test windows -debug` (remove "-debug" for official releases). Once that command finishes (it takes forever even on a higher end PC), it will automatically run the game. The .exe file will be under export\release\windows\bin.

For Mac, you need to install [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835). After that, run `lime test mac -debug` (remove "-debug" for official releases) in the project's directory. The .exe file will be in export/release/mac/bin.

For Linux, you only need to open a terminal in the project directory and run `lime test linux -debug` (remove "-debug" for official releases). The executable file will be in export/release/linux/bin.

To build for 32-bit, add `-32 -D 32bits` to the `lime test` command:

`lime test windows -32 -D 32bits`
